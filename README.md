# Cycloid CLI (cy)

This repository hosts the source code of Cycloid command line to use Cycloid APIs.

## Installation

Precompiled binaries for released versions are available in the [release](https://github.com/cycloidio/cycloid-cli/releases) page on Github.

Using the latest production release binary is the recommended way of installing the Cycloid CLI.

### In pipeline

In a pipeline, use the [`cycloid/cycloid-toolkit`](https://hub.docker.com/r/cycloid/cycloid-toolkit) image that contains a wrapper around `cy` that will automatically download and use the correct CLI version against the Cycloid API version.
