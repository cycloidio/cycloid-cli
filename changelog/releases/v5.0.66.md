## [v5.0.66] _2024-07-04_

Cycloid CLI changelog:

### CLI
**BREAKING**
- Env var TOKEN is replaced by CY_API_KEY for giving token via env var. ([CLI#274])
*The old `TOKEN` env var still works but emits a warning. It will be removed in a futur release.*
**CHANGED**
- Allow to create a project without an environment. ([CLI#278])
*The env creation with the old flags still exists, but is now deprecated and will be removed in a further release.*
- Allow to use CY_ORG env var to define the current org instead of --org flag ([CLI#274])
*You can still use the --org flag, the CLI flag will have precedence over the env var.*
- Update client to version v5.0.66 ([CLI#279])

**FIXED**
- Fix version for release ([CLI#269])

- Remove API validation on bad playload from API for catalog repository refresh ([CLI#278])

- --org flag is now global ([CLI#274])
*This fixes inconsistency between commands, you can also set the org via env vars now.*
**SECURITY**
- Make the configuration write as 0600 permissions in user home config ([CLI#274])

- Allow to login using CY_API_TOKEN instead of providing the token via --api-token flag ([CLI#274])
*This will become the default way, using the flag will be deprecated in the future.*
