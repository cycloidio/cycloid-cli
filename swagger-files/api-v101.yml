      Valid values are BlendedCost, UnblendedCost, and UsageQuantity.

      If you return the UsageQuantity metric, the service aggregates all usage
      numbers without taking into account the units. For example, if you aggregate
      usageQuantity across all of EC2, the results aren't meaningful because EC2
      compute hours and data transfer are measured in different units (for example,
      hours vs. GB). To get more meaningful UsageQuantity metrics, filter by UsageType
      or UsageTypeGroups.

        Get log's entries information  of the specified log stream stream which
        is associated to the project's environment of the specified organization.
        The log's entries to request can be filtered using the unix timestamp
        ranges and/or the query as follow
        - When unix timestamps are defined, they are converted to the specific
          query language used by the configured underlying log system (e.g AWS
          Cloud Watch, ElasticSearch, etc.) and appended to the query value
          respecting the syntax but not checking the content of the query, which
          means that if the whole query must be enclosed by curly brackets hence
          the query value is enclosed on them, the time range filter will be
          added inside not just appended at the end, because otherwise it would
          cause wrong syntax; on the other hand, not checking the content means
          that if the query contains a timerange filter, the whole query will
          contain both and the result will be the one returned by on the
          underlying log system, being an error or not.
        - When no time range are defined, then the query is used as it has been
          send, there is not modification on the query to send to the underlying
          log system, hence the result will be the one returned by it.
        - If none of the filters (timestamp range and query) are sent, then
          a 422 status code will be responded.
        - Some constraints are established by the underlying log system, so
          depending which one has been configured some parameters may be
          required or not.

        Retrieve the list of events which has been registered on the organization.
        The events to request can be filtered using by the unix timestamps (
        begin and end timestamps range), the event type and severity; when more
        than one are applied then they are applied with a logical AND.

        - The unix timestamps must be always be specified, the rest of the
          filters aren't required.
        - Some constraints are established by the third party system, which
          actual register the events; so in the hypothetical case that the same
          events would be registered in two different underlying systems, the
          list of retrieved events may be slightly different, in terms of the
          amount and the returned set, not the order.
